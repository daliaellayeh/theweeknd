            To honor the first day of Black History month, today Pepsi Super Bowl LV halftime performer The Weeknd chose a local Tampa black-owned restaurant, Mama's Southern Soul Food to feed the frontline healthcare workers at AdventHealth Carrollwood (nearby the Stadium where the Superbowl will take place) who received 150 meals delivered by Postmates, to recognize and reward their tireless efforts to save lives and keep their community safe.In May 2020, Postmates saw areas of actionable change they could take so they introduced a collection to highlight Black-Owned Restaurants in the app in all markets to make it easier to find and support black-owned businesses in their neighborhoods.  This partnership with The Weeknd marks their first collaboration in this space with a public figure and pulls the option back to the front page.
